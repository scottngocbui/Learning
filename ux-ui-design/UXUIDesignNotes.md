# ***Introduction to UX / UI***

UX is about asking questions. UI is what the user sees. It provides users with information that users first see and interact with.

## ***What is UX?***

UX means `User Experience`. It includes everything related to all the interactions that a user has with a company, its services and products. 

### *Overview*:

- Observe task
- Identify problems
- Generate ideas
- Prototype
- Test

## ***UX Goals + Quality Components***

### **Usability**

Usability is an essential concept in UX and UI design. It gauges how intuitive or easier product is to use. You could evaluate usability through five usability components:

- Learnability
- Efficiency
- Memorability
- Errors
- Satisfaction

## ***Empathy Tools: Artifacts in the UX Process***

Artifacts are documents that design teams create to gather, organize and present information throughout the UX process. 

### **User Personas**

A user persona is a model or character that portrays a possible user of your website or app. Personas aid the design team in focusing on the end users while designing a product. Personas have been used in marketing since the middle of the 1990s. They are essential to the software development process's user expeirnece research stage. 

Multiple user types can engage with a website or app. Developing user personas helps determine the range of users, their age groups, sociometric positions etc. User research is the first step in creating a user persona. UX designers can understand users' behavior and motivations by observing them and designing accordingly. 

### **Conducting Customer Interviews**

Interview at least five people. After conducting several interviews, you'll notice that you're getting very little or no new information. That means you don't need to interview any more users. Also, make use of whatever information you already have. You may have some thoughts on your customers.

### **Making Assumptions**

If you've been working on a product for quite some time, you may have enough information to make reasonably accurate assumptions about your customers. 

### **Using Web Analytics**

Web analytic tools are an excellent resource for quantitative data. They can tell you how your customers behave but not why. You'll still need to talk to them to find out what motivates them.

### **Creating a Customer Persona Group**

Once your research is complete, you divide the information into customer persona groups which will then be consolidated into single-user personas, concentrating on the primary needs of the most important user group and one significant pain point.

First, add a header to your persona; this includes a fictional name, an image, a demographic profile and a quote that summariazes what matters most to your persona. These features ensure your persona is memorable and helps the design team focus on whom they're designing for. Add a personal background, a mini-biography of sorts. Then you create a psychological profile such as the user's need, interests, motivations, and pain points.

This allows you to understand better why your user behaves in a certain way, including why they need or want to use your product. When creating user personas, remember to focus on the context of the product you're designing while you want to build up a realistic character. 

### **User Stories**

A user story is a brief statement or abstract that describes the user and their need or goal. It establishes who the user is, what they require, and why they require it. Each user persona typically has one user story. It assists in documenting helpful information about users, such as the varios needs and motivations for using a website or app. 

### **Scenarios**

A scenario is a situation that depicts how users interact with your website or app. Scenarios describe the user's motivations for being there and a question they need to be answered. They also suggest possible ways to achieve these goals. Scenarios are essentially an extension of the user sotry and can be applied to various target users. They also help stakeholders visualize the design team's idea by providing context for the intended user experience. 

### **Storyboards**

A storyboard is a visual representation of how a user will interact with a product. Designers can create different storyboards: sketches, illustrations and screenshots, slideshows and animations, or live demos. Storyboarding is an excelent method for visually communicating design concepts to teams, stakeholders, and end users. Visualizing a design idea with an interactive storyboard will help the audience remember, empathize, and connect with it.

#### *How to create a storyboard*:

To create a storyboard, set the scene by defining:

- your persona
- the environment
- the plot
